The Online Chess Game is a web-based multiplayer game that allows two players to play chess anywhere in real-time. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with WebSockets or Firebase (for real-time communication), the game replicates the traditional chess experience in a digital environment. It includes features like legal move validation, check/checkmate detection, and a clean, responsive interface.

This project helps developers understand game logic, real-time data syncing, and DOM manipulation, making it a fun and educational project for intermediate-level coders.
